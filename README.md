# Archeology
Here are some of my original works related to archeology, such as the cuneiform translate 
You can input every single word in English to the edit view and push the button ,it'll translate to the cuneiform automatically
But user need to know there's no every word could translate to cuneiform ,so there's a button beside it which could connect to
the data where documented all of word could translating to cuneiform. Hope it will help you!
